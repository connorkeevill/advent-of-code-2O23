# Advent of Code 2023
Despite my 5-day-late start, I have elected to take on 2023's Advent of code challenge with Haskell.

It's been a little while (3 years!) since I have written any Haskell, so I've had to reacquaint myself with the setup 
process for a new Haskell project (and, in fact, install Haskell on my new machine).
